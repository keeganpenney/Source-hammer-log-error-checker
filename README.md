Hammer Compile Log Error Checker

Overview
The Hammer Compile Log Error Checker is a comprehensive tool designed to assist Hammer
map developers in identifying and resolving compilation errors efficiently. Originally created to support the vibrant Hammer
mapping community, this tool analyzes compile logs, highlights errors, provides detailed explanations, and suggests actionable solutions to streamline the map development process.

Origins and History
The Hammer Compile Log Error Checker was originally conceptualized and developed by Zombie@Computer (also known as Z@C), a dedicated member of the Interlopers.net staff. Z@C crafted this tool as a community-driven resource to empower Hammer
mappers by simplifying the debugging process during map compilation. Recognizing its value, Valve incorporated the Hammer
Compile Log Error Checker into their Developer Wiki, further solidifying its role as an essential utility for Source engine developers.

Over time, the original Hammer
Compile Log Error Checker became an indispensable asset for both novice and experienced mappers, fostering a collaborative environment where developers could swiftly address and rectify common compilation issues.

Authors and Contributors
The current iteration of the Hammer
Compile Log Error Checker is a collaborative effort between Keegan Penney and ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI.

Zombie@Computer (Z@C): The original creator of the Hammer
Compile Log Error Checker. Z@C's dedication and expertise laid the foundation for the tool, making it a staple resource within the Hammer
community.

Keegan Penney: Initiated the project by providing foundational information and facilitating the modernization of the tool. While Keegan did not directly code the tool, his efforts in gathering requirements and coordinating with ChatGPT were pivotal in the tool's evolution.

ChatGPT: Assisted in expanding the tool's functionality by generating and refining the necessary code based on Keegan's prompts and requirements. Utilizing advanced models such as GPT4o, GPT-o1-preview, and GPT-o1mini, ChatGPT contributed to enhancing the tool's robustness and adaptability.

Together, Keegan and ChatGPT have modernized the Hammer
Compile Log Error Checker, making it more versatile and accessible while maintaining its core mission of supporting Hammer
map developers.

Click "Download Report" to save a text file containing all detected errors, explanations, and solutions for offline review or sharing.
Extensibility
The Hammer
Compile Log Error Checker is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing developers to modify and expand its error detection capabilities:

Add New Error Patterns:

Developers can update the errorDatabase within the script.js file to include new error patterns as they arise.

Customize Configurations:

Additional game configurations can be added to the dropdown menu in the index.html file to support a broader range of Source engine games and mods.
Enhance Functionality:

The tool's interactive features, such as tooltips and clickable errors, can be further refined or expanded based on user feedback and evolving development needs.
Note: While the Hammer
Compile Log Error Checker is a powerful tool, it is essential to remain cautious when relying solely on its diagnostics. Both developers and the underlying AI model can make mistakes, and there may be errors that the checker does not identify. Users are encouraged to use the tool as a supplementary resource and verify critical issues independently.

Disclaimer
The Hammer
Compile Log Error Checker is provided as-is, without any warranties of any kind. While every effort has been made to ensure the tool's accuracy and reliability, both Keegan Penney and ChatGPT acknowledge that errors may exist within the tool's error detection logic. Users are advised to exercise caution and perform independent verification when addressing compilation issues identified by the tool.
